# pandas-challenge

The file is in the directory labeled PyCitySchools.

I used the format provided by the PyCitySchoolsStarter file.

While working on this assignment I worked with another student (Luis Garcia) to figure out how to breakout the budget, math, and reading portions to be usable in data frames.

I also utilized the website https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html for assistance in determining what operations to use in my code.
